## duplicateFF -  Duplicate File Finder
#### A small Linux app that will search supplied directory(s) and compare files using sha256 checksum and produces reports on duplicate and unique files.      

#### This repository only contains X86-64 excutable.  For the ARM version go to [duplicateFF_for_ARM_aarch64](https://github.com/Jim-JMCD/DuplicateFF_for_ARM_aarch64)

*duplicateFF* created from the bash script [duplicate_FF](https://github.com/Jim-JMCD/duplicate-File-Finder) (private Github repository) using shc. 

### ToDo
Currently *duplicateFF* searches all the subdirectories of directories that are provided to it. ToDo - add an option to:

* Limit the search only to the supplied directories, subdirectories will not be searched.
* Limit the search only to a level of subdirectories that the user sets.
* Limit all subdirectories.
    
### Dependency
This requires a Linux bash environment to run. Will run in Microsoft WSL2(Linux), duplicateFF will not run in MSYS2, Gitbash and Cygwin environmants
An exceutable created from the *shc* utility always requires bash. More : [Github shc](https://github.com/neurobin/shc)   
                                                                              
### Notes

To move or remove duplicate files there are some suggestions in [How to delete duplicate files](https://github.com/Jim-JMCD/duplicateFF/blob/main/How%20to%20delete%20duplicate%20files.md) using the **_duplicateFF_KeepCopy_** and **_duplicateFF_RemoveALL_** scripts in this repository.

It requires a least one directory to search many directories can be compared.  Files names and maximum file sizes can be used as filters to narrow searches and save time. Reports are CSV format which can be imported into a spreadsheet. 

Directories with name '$RECYCLE.BIN' are ignored. Linux sees some MS Windows directories as executable only, a user or app can go into them but can't read them. If the Windows "executable only" directory is user accessible, it be easily corrected by respondiong to "You don't currently have permission to access this folder".  If the directory is not user accessible then its probably a system directory that is not worth checking for dulicate files.  

__Foreign Language Characters:__ If Microsoft Excel is the default application for CVS files, Microsoft Excel will not display foreign language characters correctly.  To fix this problem, change the default app for CSV files to Notepad or Wordpad and manually __import__ into excel, alternatively rename *.csv file to a *.txt and manually import into Microsoft Excel. Do not attempt to use __Open with__ and select Excel, it always has to be an __Import__.

### Usage 
duplicateFF -f 'filter' -d 'source directory' 

**_duplicateFF -f '.mp4' -m 300 -s './video/' -s '/home/fred/down loads' -o /tmp_** ..... Check all mp4 files that are smaller 300MB in Fred's down loads directory and ./video. Output will be placed in /tmp.   

Inputs of 'filter' 'source directory' 'output directory' should have single or double quotes otherwise any names with white space will not be processed.


**-f** Optional case insensitive filter, filter the source by part or the whole name of a file. This option can only be used once.

**-s** One or many directories can be entered each must start with -s.  

Setting maximum file size is optional, default is 20 GiB.  Ignoring large files can save time.

**-k or -K** kilobytes (KiB)

**-m or -M** megabytes (MiB)

**-g or -G** gigabytes (GiB)
    
_Additional Notes_
* Default output directory, will be is created in the directory from which the script is run.
* Temporary files are created in the directory from which the script is run - all removed or moved on scipt termination
* The 'filter' and 'source directory' require single or double quotes for spaces in the filter and directory input.
* Filtering example : **_-f 'rar'_** that will pick both the word 'LIBRARY' and suffix '.rar'.  They will be ignored
*  Only the first instances of -f used, the rest are ignored.
* Files with identical names and have differeing checksums are considered different files. File contents determines if they are copies.   
* The app is designed to be thorough, not designed for speed.
* Windows file systems occasionally produce some odd stuff that cannot be processed when mounted on Linux.

### OUTPUTS 

#### Outputs assume there is at least one minute between each run of duplicateFF

__../duplicate_FILES1_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__  Format – One file per row

CSV Columns 
1. sha256 checksum
2. fully pathed file name
3. full path of containing directory
4. file size in KiB
------------------------------------

__../duplicate_FILES2_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__  Format – Every row is as unique sha256 value with file size and all files of the same shar256 value. 

If more files match the checksum they are added as columns in <file> <directory> pairs i.e. repeats of columns 5 and 6.  

CSV Columns
1. sha256 checksum
2. file size in KiB 
3. fully pathed file name (file #1)
4. full path of containing directory (file #1)
5. fully pathed file name (file #2)
6. full path of containing directory (file #2)
------------------------------------
#### Outputs _cont._
A CSV list of all files processed __../all_files_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__   ...... Format: check_sum,\"\<full path\>\/\<file name\>\"

A CSV list of all unique files  __../unique_files_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__  ... Format: check_sum,\"\<full path\>\/\<file name\>\"

If unique files is missing then there are no unique files.

Basic logging __../log__yymmdd-hhmm.txt__
